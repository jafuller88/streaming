## What is video?

### The Zoopraxiscope

- A primitive version of later motion picture devices which worked by showing a sequence of still photographs in rapid succession, providing a sense of motion. 
- Invented by British photographer Eadweard Muybridge (1879).

### Digital
 - Digital video is an electronic representation of moving visual images in the form of encoded digital data.

```
$ ffprobe -i img/gif/got.gif 
...
Input #0, gif, from 'img/gif/got.gif':
  Duration: 00:00:01.60, start: 0.000000, bitrate: 4926 kb/s
    Stream #0:0: Video: gif, bgra, 500x281, 5 fps, 5 tbr, 100 tbn, 100 tbc
```
```
$ ffmpeg -i img/gif/got.gif img/gif/got%02d.png
```

8 / 1.6s = 5fps

24fps
- This is the standard for movies and TV shows, and it was determined to be the minimum speed needed to capture video while still maintaining realistic motion.
- Even if a film is shot at a higher frame rate, itâ€™s often produced and displayed at 24fps.

30+fps
- Videos with a lot of motion, such as sports, will often benefit from the extra frames per second.

## Video Encoding and Transcoding
<ins>Compression</ins>
- A Video Codec is software based on an algorithm that allows for compression or decompression of digital video.
- Video compression is the process of encoding a video file in such a way that it consumes less space than the original file and is easier to transmit over the network.
- H.264 is a digital video compression standard that uses half the space of MPEG-2 (the DVD standard) to deliver the same quality video.

<ins>Group Of Pictures (GOP) and Key Frames</ins>

- The length of the GOP stands for the number of frames between two
I-frames. 

<img src="./img/gop.png"/>

- By default, the Frame Rate and length of GOP have the same value in our
cameras. 
- By increasing the length of GOP, there will be less I-frames per a certain amount of time. 
- The main benefit of using higher GOP length is to minimize bandwidth consumption and minimize storage space consumption (reduce bitrate) under same frame rate. 
- Transcoding is taking already-compressed (or encoded) content; decompressing (decoding) it; and then altering and recompressing it.

## Encoding and Packaging Video for HTTP Live Streaming (HLS)

- HTTP Live Streaming is a HTTP-based communications protocol. Originally implemented by Apple as part of its QuickTime, Safari, OS X, and iOS software.
- HLS works by breaking the overall stream into a sequence of small segments. 
- A list of available streams, encoded at different bit rates, is sent to the client using an M3U8 playlist.
- Adaptive Bitrate Streaming (ABR)
- Wowza is an example software based off the shelf solution for segmenting and packaging HLS video and audio. It will also act as a the origin webserver to deliver the content over HTTP.

### ffmpeg
Written in C - open source https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg

https://ffmpeg.org/download.html

Install static version

https://johnvansickle.com/ffmpeg/releases/ffmpeg-release-amd64-static.tar.xz

### Examples
Convert from 1 container format to another
```
$ ffmpeg -i BigBuckBunny.mp4 -vcodec copy BigBuckBunny.avi
$ ffmpeg -i BigBuckBunny.mp4 -b:v 1000k BigBuckBunny.avi
```
Clip part of a video
```
$ ffmpeg -ss 00:15:40 -i got.mkv -ss 00:01:00 -t 00:00:30 -map 0:0 -map 0:2 got.mp4
```
Extract frames from video
```
$ ffmpeg -i got.mp4 got%02d.png
```
Show details about the Container
```
$ ffprobe -i video/got.mp4 
```

### ffmpeg to stream hls
Transcode to different bitrates.
```
ffmpeg -i video/got.mp4 \
    -preset veryfast -g 24 -sc_threshold 0 \
    -map v:0 -c:v:0 libx264 -b:v:0 600k \
    -map v:0 -c:v:1 libx264 -b:v:1 1000k \
    -map a:0 -map a:0 -c:a aac -b:a 128k \
    -f hls -hls_time 5 -hls_playlist_type vod \
    -master_pl_name master.m3u8 \
    -var_stream_map "v:0,a:0 v:1,a:1" ./dist/video/stream_%v.m3u8
```

-c:v libx264 Encode Video using x264.

-c:a aac Encode Audio as AAC.

-b:v The Video Bitrate.

-b:a 128k The Audio Bitrate.

-g 24 Sets the group size to 24. The video source has 24 FPS. So each second will start with a new picture group. This option forces a target size of 24 frames. After that a new group will be created (starting with a new I-Frame).

-f hls Output Format HLS.

-hls_time Target duration for each segment.

-hls_playlist_type vod Video On Demand.


## Playing Video Streams with HTML5 and hls.js
### hls.js
https://github.com/video-dev/hls.js
https://github.com/video-dev/hls.js/blob/master/docs/API.md
https://www.npmjs.com/package/hls.js

### Setup
For this demo Typescript and the [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) build system has been used.

Build and deploy
```
$ gulp
$ gulp copy-html
$ sudo ./deploy.bat
```

## Latency concerns
<img src="./img/Low_latency_delay.jpg"/>

## Other formats

- FLASH is Dead!
- Web RTC?

<ins>CMAF - Common Media Application Format</ins>
- By splitting segments into chunks, a streaming server can make chunks within a segment available already while the entire segment has not been completed yet. 
- This changes the situation as players can download the individual chunks ahead of time, and buffers can be filled faster. This allows a reduction of the end-to-end latency significantly.
